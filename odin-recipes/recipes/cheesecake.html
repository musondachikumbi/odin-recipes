            <li>Filling: 4 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, softened; 1 cup sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 4 large eggs.</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan to form the crust.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust in the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 50-60 minutes or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
            <li>Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set completely.</li>
            <li>Before serving, top with fresh fruit or fruit compote if desired.</li>
