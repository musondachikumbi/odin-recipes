        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="color">Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li> Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>· Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li> Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
            <li> Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li> Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
            <li> Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li> 
            <h4>steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground meat and diced onion over medium heat until browned.</li>
                <li>Add the canned tomatoes, fresh herbs, sugar, and spices. Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of meat sauce in a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, then a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used.</li>
                <li>Top with shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
                <p>ENJOY!😋</p>
